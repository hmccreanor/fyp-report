specific: 
  + evaluation (1hr)
    - basically try and have a figure on how much we think we could improve this by
  + conclusion (1hr)

  x related work (1hr)
    x distserve

  + whatever this stuff is (1hr)
    + i actually think i should restructure this to move model memory requirements and memory split into its own section or just part of problem setting
    + i think i then move kv prefix cache thing into optimisations and basically show that it is optimal

    + add pseudocode to explain how we checked for cache thrashing 
    + fix pseudocode for tree search 

general (tomorrow morning):
  + improve introduction section!
  + reread everything 
  + add more detail on experiments
  + at the end of each related work - basically just speak about how it is related to what i am doing

general (tomorrow):
  + improve figures
  + diagrams?
