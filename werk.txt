+ reread everything (1hr)
  + add more detail on experiments 
  + at the end of each related work - basically just speak about how it is related to what i am doing 

fuck this i don't have time:
+ graph showing num blocks used as a function of max_num_seqs?
  - I think just get two plots with max_num_seqs
+ graph goes here with guo's time breakdown thingy
  - i guess just overall time minus generate?
+ improve figures?
+ prefix caching diagram
