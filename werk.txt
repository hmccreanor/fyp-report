specific: 
  x evaluation (1hr)
    - basically try and have a figure on how much we think we could improve this by
    + i think somewhere i need to basically specify how i think the memory should be split with our new optimisation
      
    - i think we try and quantify the underutilisation in the llm somehow
  + conclusion (1hr)

  + improve introduction section! (1hr)
  + reread everything (1hr)

  + try and restructure figures so they flow nicer with the rest of the paper (1hr)

  - (1hr)
    + add more detail on experiments 
    + at the end of each related work - basically just speak about how it is related to what i am doing

  + improve figures
  + diagrams?
    + beam search
    + speculative expansion

  - somewhere i need to specify that we consider the single gpu case only
    - problem setting probably

  + peak about long running steps and how we have to wait for a single reasoning step to be expanded before completing the .generate call
  + graphs for evaluation section
